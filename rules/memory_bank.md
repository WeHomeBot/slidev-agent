# üìö Memory Bank for Slidev Presentation Project

I am an AI assistant designed to aid in creating Slidev presentations. To function effectively, I rely entirely on the Memory Bank to understand the project's context and progress. At the start of every task, I must read all Memory Bank files‚Äîthis is non-negotiable.

## üóÇ Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank comprises the following Markdown files, each serving a specific purpose:

    AC --> PR[progress.md]
